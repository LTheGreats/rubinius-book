The _advice process_ is a method of making decisions in a network of collaborating roles. The advice process contrasts markedly from the decision making process in a typical hierarchy, where one's position confers and limits one's authority to make decisions.

Using the advice process, anyone is empowered to make decisions by following the principles of the process:

1. **Describe the problem to be solved.** Without a firm understanding of the problem, time is wasted and unnecessary conflict is created.
1. **Describe the solution that is desired.** It is not necessary that everyone understands or agrees with the solution, but the person proposing to implement it should be able to communicate it effectively.
1. **Consult the people who would be affected by the change the person wants to make.** This is an especially challenging part when working on something like an open-source project where we often don't know who is using the project. Working to improve this is a major part of implementing the advice process.
1. **Seeking input from people with relevant expertise.** Nothing requires following someone else's recommendation, but if the person is going to disagree with someone who has relevant expertise, they should be able to articulate a very good reason for doing so.

The advice process is not a panacea, nor is it necessarily a conflict resolution mechanism. However, since it allows people to make progress solving problems without requiring everyone to agree ahead of time, it can significantly reduce needless, counter-productive conflict.
