# The Rubinius Book

This is a book about building a community and language platform.

It is about building a community because all technology is embedded in a human context. If we want a community with desirable characteristics, we have to be purposeful about building and nurturing the community.

It is about building a language platform because languages are the most powerful tools we have created for processing and sharing information. Technology is essential to advancing our understanding of the world and solving problems. Human health and well-being is intimately intertwined with our developing technology.

In the span of human history, computers are very young. The Internet is even younger and its ability to connect people across vast physical distances, cultures, languages, political systems, and belief systems is unprecedented. As people who live in this time and enjoy tremendous privileges, we are obligated to try to help people use these systems for improving, not just changing, the world.

This is a book about one small attempt to do that.
