# Preface

> Nothing pleases people more than to go on thinking what they have always thought, and at the same time imagine that they are thinking something new and daring; it combines the advantage of security with the delight of adventure &mdash; TS Eliot

> It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so. &mdash; Mark Twain

> Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple &mdash; Dr. Seuss

> You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. &mdash; R. Buckminster Fuller

> Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats. &mdash; Howard H. Aiken
