# Preface

> Nothing pleases people more than to go on thinking what they have always thought, and at the same time imagine that they are thinking something new and daring; it combines the advantage of security with the delight of adventure &mdash; TS Eliot

Nothing in this book is really new. There are certainly no silver bullets that will make you wildly rich, world famous, or powerful as presidents. However, I do hope your view of programming will change after reading it. The change may be slight, or it may be significant, but the change in your perspective is the reason for this book.

There are two things I want to change about the way we typically view programming.

The first is that programming is _too special_. Far too many people are excluded from programming and we are not doing enough to change that. I want to make programming mundane.

> It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so. &mdash; Mark Twain

The second is that programming is too limited. We have extremely crude and primitive tools for programming. Even worse, much of the _conventional knowledge_ about programming is just wrong.

> Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple &mdash; Dr. Seuss

> You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. &mdash; R. Buckminster Fuller

> Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats. &mdash; Howard H. Aiken
